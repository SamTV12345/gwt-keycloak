# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Remove deployment from TravisCI infrastructure as it is no longer feasible.
* Remove `{@inheritDoc}` as it only explicitly indicates that the default behaviour at the expense of significant visual clutter.
* Change the API for attaching listeners to the `Keycloak` instance. Rather than `Keycloak.setListener(...)` class to allow multiple listeners to be notified when keycloak events occur. This is a breaking API change.
